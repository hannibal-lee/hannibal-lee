Oliveira Lee

Senior Backend Engineer with a professional focus on distributed systems, performance engineering, and intelligent agent architecture.

About Me

I am a software engineer with over six years of experience, holding a deep background in building and optimizing high-concurrency, low-latency systems within the demanding financial sector. My core expertise lies in the Java ecosystem, cloud-native (Kubernetes) architecture, and resilient event-driven (Kafka) platforms.

My current work involves applying this rigorous engineering foundation to the Python ecosystem, where I am focused on the development and orchestration of complex, stateful AI Agents.

Current Area of Focus

AI Agent Orchestration: Designing and implementing complex, multi-step agentic workflows using LangGraph (State Machines, Conditional Edges).

RAG Pipelines: Implementing robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems (Chunking, Embedding, Milvus/Weaviate).

Tooling: Exposing services and capabilities to LLMs as secure tools (e.S. using FastAPI).

⚡ A Quick Look at My Journey

Senior Engineer @ Citigroup (Current): Building cloud-native (K8s), low-latency (10ms) risk engines with Java, gRPC, and Kafka. Currently prototyping LangGraph-based AI Agents for deep compliance analysis.

Java Developer @ Huawei (OD): Developed large-scale issue tracking systems, optimizing database queries and building async task pipelines with Kafka and Redis.

Self-Taught Engineer: My original degree was in Geological Engineering. I am 100% self-taught in software development, a journey that proves my ability to rapidly master new, complex domains.
